# Introduction

This Github contains some projects donc by me, in a non-exhaustive way, for school. 

# Remarks

C++ programs have no restrictions except using C++98 and standard libraries.


The projects on this Github are mostly made for school, so a few aspects of my work have to be explained beforehand, all applying strictly to C programming because of the school rules : 
- The school requires us to make our functions 25 lines at max.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- No declaration and assignment on the same line.
- No for loops authorised, only while loops.

A few other rules apply, but overall those are the main elements you should keep in mind while checking the C projects available on this Github. For projects in other languages, no restrictions are applied.
