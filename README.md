The projects that can be found on this Github are mostly related to the work done as a student.
Therefore, a few aspects of my work have to be explained beforehand, all applying strictly to C programming because of the school rules : 
- The school requires us to make our functions 25 lines at max.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- No declaration and assignment on the same line.
- No for loops authorisedm only while loops.

A few other rules apply, but overall those are the main elements you should keep in mind while checking the C projects available on this Github. For projects in other languages, no restrictions are applied.
